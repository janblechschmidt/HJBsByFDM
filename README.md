# HJBsByFDM
This repository contains Matlab code for the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-divergence form by finite difference methods. 
It supports many example problems defined in the files named `example_*_Problem.m`, while the optimal controls in the case of HJB equations are defined in `example_*_Control.m`.
The script `solveProblem` contains already many commented example problems and should serve as a good starting point for further experiments.
The scripts `solveProblem`, those starting with `experiment_*` and those starting with `diss_` contain the most recent experiments that where used to prepare the figures in my Dissertation.
